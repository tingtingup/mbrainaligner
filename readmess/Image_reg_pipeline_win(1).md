Registration of whole-brain images of different modalities onto a standard atlas is essential for characterizing neuron types and constructing brain wiring diagrams. Here we introduce a step-by-step tutorial of using mBrainAligner to register the fMOST image to Allen Common Coordinate Framework atlas (CCFv3). 

Since the brain area in CCFv3 average template is close to image boundaries in the anterior-posterior direction, to eliminate the computational ambiguity, we padded the CCFv3 average template (25µm) by 20 pixels in both ends of anterior-posterior axes and use the padded image as the target. **Note that** only 50um CCFv3 and sample images are provided here to faciliate the network transfer and storage. The downsampled and padded CCFv3 average template can be found in `examples/target/CCF_25_u8_xpad.v3draw` (see Appendix for detailed meaning of files in ` examples/target/` folder). 

We assume all example and executable files are in the original folder structure as shown in the github. 


**Step 1: Image downsampling**

The raw whole mouse brain image stack of fMOST modality generally has the volume size of 40k x 30k x 10k voxels. First, we need to downsample the raw image anisotropically to roughly match the size of the target image (we recommend using CCFv3 25um to achieve a good balance between registration accuracy and computation time). 


**Step 2: Brightness optimization and stripe artifact removal** 

We developed `matlab_preprocessing` tool to remove the periodic stripe noise, large artifacts  and adaptive brightness adjustment for the original image.This tool was implement in Matlab,the source code can be found in `src\src_othertools\matlab_preprocessing\`. 

Open Matlab and navigate to the `/src/src_othertools/matlab_preprocessing/` directory, and modify script `main.m`
  ```
  foldername_input='.../../../examples/subject/preprocess'; % Input filepath
  foldername_output='../../../examples/subject/preprocess'; % Output filepath
  curdir=dir(foldername_input);
  ch_s=1; % stripe_removal switch, 0:closed; 1:open;
  DOWN=2; % Downsample size
  Artifact=13; % pixel of artifact,[0~255];
  direction=0; % slice direction to removing stripe, 0:coronal; 1:horizontal; 2:sagittal;
  angle=0; % between the filter direction and the horizontal axis [0~360];
  cutoff=15; % filter cutoff;
  radius=5; % filter width;
  
  ```
Run`main.m`,This script will support  `.raw` , `.v3draw` , `.nii` or `.nii.gz` files in the specified directory `../../../examples/subject/` and output the results images to directory `../../../examples/subject/*_preprocess.*`. 
you could modify manually the parameters in source code to determine the "angle (orientation), cutoff (cutoff frequency), radius (bandwidth) , direction(slice direction)" parameters of notch filter by examining the frequency spectrum of one 2D coronal slice of subject image.
  
**Note that** stripe_removal step may not be necessay if there is no tissue sectioning involved in the imaging process. 


**Step 3: Global affine registration and intensity normalization**

- open terminal in windows, and run the following commands：
  ```
  cd <your mBrainAligner_win64 directory>
  
  <your mBrainAligner_win64 directory>/global_registration.exe -f ../../examples/target/25um/ -m ../../examples/result/fMOST/global.v3draw -p r+f -o ../../examples/result/fMOST/ -d 1

  ```

The globally aligned image will be save in the `results` directory. 
If we use parameter `-p r+f+n`, the intensity normalization will be performed following the global registration. 

if we use parameter `-u 1`,GPU mode open;if we use parameter `-u 0`,GPU mode close;

The detailed desciption of all avialble parameters can be found in `examples/run_script_windows.bat`.

**(OPTIONAL) Perform global registration manually**

For partially imaged or damaged images, if you cannot obtain satisfactory results with automatic global registration, you try to implement it by providing matching points manually. 
1. Launch the Vaa3D software (http://penglab.janelia.org/proj/v3d);

2. Drag the target image (e.g. `examples/target/25um/CCF_u8_xpad.v3draw`) and subject image (e.g. `examples/subject/fMOST_18458_raw.v3draw` into Vaa3D window. Once images are loaded, you will see the following window.

  </center>

3.  Click `See in 3D` buton to display the image in 3D mode. Right-click the mouse and select the "2-right-clicks to define a maker" button to generate matching marker-pairs in two images. The number of marker is preferably more than 10, and then save the two sets of points as marker files (example: target_global.marker,sub_global.marker).

4. open terminal in windows, and run the following commands：
```
cd <your mBrainAligner_win64 directory>
<your mBrainAligner_win64 directory>/global_registration.exe -f ../../examples/target/25um/  -p a -o ../../examples/result/fMOST/ -d 1 -t target_global.marker -s sub_global.marker

```
The image to be warpped (“examples/subject/fMOST_18458_raw.v3draw”), and the result image will be saved ("examples/result/fMOST/fMOST_18458_raw_affine.v3draw"). However, it is not necessary in our pipeline since the local registraion module can do it much better.

**Step 4: Local registration**

open terminal in windows, and run the following commands：
```
<your mBrainAligner_win64 directory>/local_registration.exe -p ../../examples/config/fMOST_config.txt -s ../../examples/result/fMOST/global.v3draw -m ../../examples/subject/fMOST_segmentation/ -l ../../examples/target/target_landmarks/low_landmarks.marker  -g ../../examples/target/ -o ../../examples/result/fMOST/
```
if we use parameter `-u 1`,GPU mode open;if we use parameter `-u 0`,GPU mode close;
The local registration parameters are defined in `fMOST_config.txt`. Noted that if you don't have segmentation images, the `Select_modal` in the `fMOST_config.txt` needs to be set to 1. The detailed desciption of all avialble parameters can be found in `examples/run_script_windows.bat`.
The globally aligned image will be save in the `results` directory.

**Appendix (meaning of files in `examples/target/` folder)**
1.	CCF_mask.v3draw

    The foreground mask of CCFv3 average template. It is generated using Otsu thersholding.

2.	CCF_contour.v3draw

    The out-coutour mask of CCFv3 average template. It is generated from CCF_mask.v3draw using morphological filters. 

3.	CCF_roi.v3draw

    Mask of interest brain regions. Run `src/src_othertools/process/annotation_recolor.ipynb` to generate the `CCF_roi.v3draw` image which contains the mask of  six mouse brain region (HY, HPF, CTX, CBX, BS and CP). You can still set the brain region of interest according to your needs. 
    The specific operations are: 
    - Select the number of the region you are interested in from `Mouse.csv`, for example, CTX is 688. 
    - Modify the `areas_ids` of "In [18]" in `annotation_recolor.ipynb`, and input the number of the brain region you need in `areas_ids`.

4.	fMOST_space_prior_sub.marker and fMOST_space_prior_tar.marker

    These files are optional in registration, it can only be used when registering fMOST mouse brain. It contains modality-specific shape priors that can improve the performance of local registration. One can obtain these markers files by first registering the fMOST average templete to the CCFv3 average template using automatic local reigistration module, and then finetuning the registration result using semi-automatic registration. The semi-automatic registration module will generates these markers files as output.

5.	target_landmarks

    The marker files in “target_landmarks” are predefined target landmarks used for local registration which are generated using 2.5D corner detector. Three different densities of landmark (low, middle, high) are provided. Generally, better registration performance can be obtained if more target landmarks are used, however, with the cost of computation time.
